# Tensor Computation for Data Processing

##Description


Many classical data processing methods rely on representation and computation in the form of vectors and matrices, where multi-dimensional data are unfolded into matrix for processing. However, the multi-linear structure would be lost in such vectorization or matricization, which leads to sub-optimal performance in processing. In fact, a natural representation for multi-dimensional data is tensor. The tensor computation based processing methods can avoid multi-linear data structure loss in classical matrix based counterparts. The related advances in applied mathematics allow us to move from classical matrix based methods to tensor based methods for many applications, such as machine learning, signal processing, neuroscience, communication, psychometric, chemometrics, biometric, quantum physics, quantum chemistry, etc. As typical kinds of multi-dimensional data, multimedia data could be more efficiently and effectively processed by tensor computations based data processing techniques.


This tutorial will first provide a basic coverage of tensor notations, preliminary operations, main tensor decompositions and their properties. Based on them, a series of tensor processing methods are presented, as the multi-linear extensions of classical sparse learning, missing component analysis, principal component analysis, subspace cluster, linear regression, support vector machine, deep neural network, etc. The experimental results for a number of data processing applications are given, such as image reconstruction, image quality enhancement, multimedia data fusion, background extraction, weather forecasting, pose estimation, source separation in speech, etc. Finally, some acceleration strategies are discussed for some more possible applications.
